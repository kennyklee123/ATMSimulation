# PandaATM
This is an Android app that simulates a real life experience of using an ATM.  This project's entire backend was implemented using Java and the database was built using SQLite.  Our front-end was built using Android Studios that is connected to our server using TCP Sockets which allows multiple multiple concrrent users.

# Usage
To run this program, you must start up the server on your local machine. 
This is done by going to ATM/src/com/group7/pandaatm and in the main below in the code, enter a port to connect to (your local machine's port). 
Once this is done, you can just start up Android Studios with our code and it is ready to use!
You may need to check the database for log in credentials, as most of the fake bank accounts were pre-made prior.
