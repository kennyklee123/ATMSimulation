# PandaATM
This is a program that simulates a real life experience of using an ATM.  It was created using SQLite and Java for the back-end, the front end was built in Android Studios, and we connected the two using socket.  

# Usage
To run this program, you must start up the server on your local machine. 
This is done by going to ATM/src/com/group7/pandaatm and in the main below in the code, enter a port to connect to (your local machine's port). 
Once this is done, you can just start up Android Studios with our code and it is ready to use!
You may need to check the database for log in credentials, as most of the fake bank accounts were pre-made prior.
