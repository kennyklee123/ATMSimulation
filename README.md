## Run the Project in a Local Development Environment
To run this program, you must start up the server on your local machine. 
This is done by going to ATM/src/com/group7/pandaatm and in the main below in the code, enter a port to connect to (your local machine's port). 
Once this is done, you can just start up Android Studios with our code and it is ready to use!
